Physics-Python-Recipes
======================

Data processing and visualization recipes for physicists with python.

This project collects practical recipes for experimental physicists (may be also useful to other sciences), but has nothing to do with computational physics. 

Data processing like fitting, interpolation, differential, spectrum analysis and so on in real world should be pulled in. 

Visualization contains not only plot skills to display experimental dataset, but also codes for generating simple demonstration of some physical phenomena and process, such as double pendulum. The interactive plotting recipes, that is, display in browser using Ipython Notebook or other JS binding techniques, should be added.

Also I decide to add an extra file for other things, which may be suitable for this repository.

Of course, the usage of each recipe should be hard-coded as comments.
